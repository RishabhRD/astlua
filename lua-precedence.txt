exp is broken down into several rules to reflect different precedence levels.
Logical OR (or) has the lowest precedence.
Logical AND (and) has higher precedence than or.
Comparison operators (<, <=, >, >=, ==, ~=) have higher precedence than logical operators.
Concatenation (..) has higher precedence than comparison operators.
Addition and subtraction (+, -) have higher precedence than concatenation.
Multiplication, division, and modulo (*, /, %) have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
Unary operators (-, not, #) have higher precedence than multiplication, division, and modulo.
Exponentiation (^) has the highest precedence.
